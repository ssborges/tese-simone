% This chapter revisits the research problem and the RQs (Section 7.1). Drawing on the
% findings of our investigation, we further elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages
% of extending JIT compilers to support software testing techniques (Section 7.2). This
% chapter also restates the contributions (Section 7.3), discusses the current limitations
% (Section 7.4) of our proof-of-concept implementation, and suggests future research directions
% (Section 7.5). The chapter concludes with a discussion of the relevance of this research and
% a summary of the technical challenges faced when extending Maxine VM (Section 7.6).
